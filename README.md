================

Allwinner A20 (sun7i) SoC features a Dual-Core Cortex-A7 ARM CPU, and a Mali400 MP2 GPU from ARM. Allwinner A20 can mostly be seen as a low-end or budget version of the A31 because it shares its Cortex-A7 ARM CPU architecture, but at the same time it is also a bit similar to the A10 because it also features a Mali400 GPU, and in addition, the A20 is pin-compatible[1] with its predecessor single-core A10, that means it could greatly simplify the product development process and allows faster time to market. Besides, when compared with A10, A20 is superior in its ultra-low power consumption, which will deeply impress Android tablet and set-top box users.
